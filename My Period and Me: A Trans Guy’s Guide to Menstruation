My Period and Me: A Trans Guy’s Guide to Menstruation
November 4, 2014 by Wiley Reading

I’m doing the cramp wiggle at my desk chair right now.

You know, the seat acrobatics you do when you’ve got cramps, but you’re too lazy to get up and get Advil, and it hasn’t gotten bad enough yet that you’ve got to lie on the ground with your butt up in the air.

It’s funny. When I initially began writing this article, I hadn’t had anything resembling a period in months. And then my doctor switched my birth control on me, and my reproductive organs took full advantage of the slight change in hormones. My body really, really wants to menstruate, y’all.


Oh. This might be a good time to mention that I’m a dude – one with a uterus. A very, very excitable uterus.

I actually did okay when the Great Body Part Mechanic in the Sky was handing out body parts. I have broad shoulders; fat settles on my belly instead of my thighs; and I have narrow hips. I’m built like a little bull (or refrigerator).

So although I don’t take testosterone, my body looks male in many ways that are important to me.

Unfortunately, there’s still my reproductive system.

When I got my period – at eleven – I discovered that my female hormones were just about as excited about menstruation as they could possibly be.

I used to think that this was something I’d just have to deal with, like my small hands and long eyelashes. But then, my psychiatrist prescribed me birth control pills.

She had correctly identified that I’m least stable in the weeks before and after my period. So I got to take BC for “continuous suppression of periods.”

I mostly get to forget that I can have periods. But I can’t pretend that I’m going to be able to avoid it permanently. Every once in a while, I have a full blown period attack.

So that’s my life. My period is going to period whenever it gets the chance.

It’s not easy. Everyone in the world thinks periods are the ultimate expression of femininity. Sometimes it makes me feel very, very feminine.

But the truth is, there’s no reason bleeding makes me feminine. Gynomastia doesn’t make men women, and my period doesn’t make me one either.

Most trans guys have to deal with their periods at some point or another. It’s not something we talk about — a lot of us are ashamed, which is understandable.

But this shouldn’t be a shameful thing. We should be able to talk about what our bodies are doing and help each other out with tips and support.

I’m trying to start a conversation both about why menstruation isn’t an inherently female thing — if trans men experience it, it can’t be truly female, can it? — and how talking about our bodies is sometimes the best way to fight dysphoria and learn new things about how to improve our lives.

Periods happen to lots and lots of people. Many of them are women and girls, but those of us who are something else should have a context for our experience and a way of talking about it without being misgendered.

So here’s what I do to help myself feel better when I’m getting a visit from Aunt Period.

1. Avoid ‘Feminine Products’ 

I like not to wear pads or tampons or any sort of quote-unquote “feminine product.”

This is not possible for everyone, and it’s not even possible for me without the aid of birth control.

When I do need to buy them, sometimes I ask my girlfriend to buy them for me; sometimes I make a lot of jokes about it in my head. I remind myself that the cashier definitely does not care what I’m purchasing. If I’m feeling particularly fragile about it, I avoid stores where I might run into the same cashier again.

But when it is possible, it makes me feel more like myself experiencing a medical condition and less like I’m a lady flower experiencing lady uterus ladyship.
